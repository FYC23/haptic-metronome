# Haptic Metronome

[English](README.md) | [中文](README.zh.md)

Open-source wearable haptic metronome designed for promoting speech fluency. Firmware is STM32G431-based; mechanical and manufacturing files included separately.

This is a project of [Capella Speech](https://capella-speech.org), a student-run organization focused on raising awareness and gathering accessible resources for speech impairment. The original and non‑manufacturable version was designed and developed by Capella Speech; the manufacturable version was developed in collaboration with [Wayi Robotics (哇一机器人)](https://wayi-edu.com/).
